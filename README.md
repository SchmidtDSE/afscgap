Python-based tool chain ("Pyafscgap.org") for working with the public bottom trawl data from the [NOAA AFSC GAP](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/contact/groundfish-assessment-program). This provides information from multiple survey programs about where certain species were seen and when under what conditions, information useful for research in ocean health.

See [webpage](https://pyafscgap.org), [project Github](https://github.com/SchmidtDSE/afscgap), and [example notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/SchmidtDSE/afscgap/main?urlpath=/tree/index.ipynb).

<br>
<br>

## Quickstart
Taking your first step is easy!

**Explore the data in a UI:** To learn about the datasets, try out an in-browser visual analytics app at [https://app.pyafscgap.org](https://app.pyafscgap.org) without writing any code.

**Try out a tutorial in your browser:** Learn from and modify an in-depth [tutorial notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/SchmidtDSE/afscgap/main?urlpath=/tree/index.ipynb) in a free hosted academic environment (all without installing any local software).

**Jump into code:** Ready to build your own scripts? Here's an example querying for Pacific cod in the Gulf of Alaska for 2021:

```python
import afscgap  # install with pip install afscgap
query = afscgap.Query()
query.filter_year(eq=2021)
query.filter_srvy(eq='GOA')
query.filter_scientific_name(eq='Gadus macrocephalus')
results = query.execute()
```

Continue your exploration in the [developer docs](https://pyafscgap.org/docs/usage/).

<br>
<br>

## Installation
Ready to take it to your own machine? Install the open source tools for accessing the AFSC GAP via Pypi / Pip:

```bash
$ pip install afscgap
```

The library's only dependency is [requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/index.html) and [Pandas / numpy are not expected but supported](https://pyafscgap.org/docs/usage/#pandas). The above will install the release version of the library. However, you can also install the development version via:

```bash
$ pip install git+https://github.com/SchmidtDSE/afscgap.git@main
```

Installing directly from the repo provides the "edge" version of the library which should be treated as pre-release.

## Purpose
Unofficial Python-based tool set for interacting with [bottom trawl surveys](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/alaska/commercial-fishing/alaska-groundfish-bottom-trawl-survey-data) from the [Ground Fish Assessment Program (GAP)](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/contact/groundfish-assessment-program). It offers:

 - Pythonic access to the official [NOAA AFSC GAP API service](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/foss/f?p=215%3A28).
 - Tools for inference of the "negative" observations not provided by the API service.
 - Visualization tools for quickly exploring and creating comparisons within the datasets, including for audiences with limited programming experience.

Note that GAP are an excellent collection of datasets produced by the [Resource Assessment and Conservation Engineering (RACE) Division](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/resource-assessment-and-conservation-engineering-division) of the [Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC)](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/alaska-fisheries-science-center) as part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Fisheries organization ([NOAA Fisheries](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/)).

Please see our [objectives documentation](https://pyafscgap.org/docs/objectives/) for additional information about the purpose, developer needs addressed, and goals of the project.

## Usage
This library provides access to the AFSC GAP data with optional zero catch ("absence") record inference.

<br>

### Examples / tutorial
One of the best ways to learn is through our examples / tutorials series. For more details see our [usage guide](https://pyafscgap.org/docs/usage/).

<br>

### API Docs
[Full formalized API documentation is available](https://pyafscgap.org/devdocs/afscgap.html) as generated by pdoc in CI / CD.

<br>

### Data structure
Detailed information about our data structures and their relationship to the data structures found in NOAA's upstream database is available in our [data model documentation](https://pyafscgap.org/docs/model/).

<br>

### Absence vs presence data
By default, the NOAA API service will only return information on hauls matching a query. So, for example, requesting data on Pacific cod will only return information on hauls in which Pacific cod is found. This can complicate the calculation of important metrics like catch per unit effort (CPUE). That in mind, one of the most important features in `afscgap` is the ability to infer "zero catch" records as enabled by `set_presence_only(False)`. See more information in [our inference docs](https://pyafscgap.org/docs/inference/).

<br>

### Data quality and completeness
There are a few caveats for working with these data that are important for researchers to understand. These are detailed in our [limitations docs](https://pyafscgap.org/docs/limitations/).
